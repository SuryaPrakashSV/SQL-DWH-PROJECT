## ðŸ™Œ Credits

Special thanks to [@DataWithBaraa](https://github.com/DataWithBaraa) for their original [SQL Data Warehouse Project](https://github.com/DataWithBaraa/sql-data-warehouse-project), which inspired and guided the structure of this work. Their approach helped shape my understanding of medallion architecture and real-world ETL workflows.

# SQL Data Warehouse Project

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my **SQL Data Warehouse Project** repository.

This project demonstrates a hands-on implementation of a **Medallion Architecture-based Data Warehouse** using **Microsoft SQL Server**, complete with optimized **ETL pipelines**, clean **data modeling**, and actionable **SQL-based analytics**. Designed as a portfolio project, it showcases real-world data engineering practicesâ€”from data ingestion to insight generation.
